          Create a new local repository in your computer and open it with VS
          Code:
          <ul>
            <li>Add a file named index.html.</li>
            <li>Add a boiler plate typing “html:5” and clicking enter.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a remote repository in Github
          <ul>
            <li>Name it git-flow-practice</li>
            <li>Hit create repository</li>
            <li>
              Follow the quick setup instructions to push an exiting repository
              from the command line (second option that Github will give you).
              Did you get any errors? If you did, why? Search the error in
              google and see if you can solve this issue on your own.
