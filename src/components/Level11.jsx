      <p>
        As you can see, now that <b>origin/main</b> has been updated with the
        code of one of the teammembers, it is causing issues for the others.
        This issues can happen when pushing into <b>origin/main</b> without a
        pull request, so our teammates dont know main has been updated. To avoid
        those issues, we can protect the main branch from unwanted pushes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each one of the teammates can go to their own repo in Github.

            <li>
              Go into the repository:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If there is a notification with{' '}
                  <i>Your branch isnÂ´t protected</i>, just click on{' '}
                  <b>Protect this branch</b> button.
